### MCMF
#### Progress/Accomplishments:
- PowerBI visualization of Chicago neighborhoods and availability of free food/transportation for different programs 
- Explored availability of equitable programs based on neighborhood (based on price, food, transportation)
- Used supplementary dataset from CMAP to explore demographics by location & identify which neighborhoods are underserved
#### Problems/Challenges:
- Supplmentary dataset is really big and will need to do more in depth exploration to figure out which specific information would be useful to our project
#### Plan/Next Steps:
-  Explore CMAP dataset in more depth
- Visualization of two datasets using PowerBI 

### Kaggle
#### Progress/Accomplishments:
- Refined EDA & feature selection 
  - Imputation via KNN=5
  - Drop columns of 0/1's
  - Drop columns with low variance
  - Create scree plot to find optimal PCs for PCA
- Tuned XGBoost, AdaBoost, RandomForest, SVM, ElasticNet models
- Enesembled above models using LassoCV
#### Problems/Challenges:
- Having trouble reducing RMSE; not sure if our feature selection was optimal
#### Plan/Next Steps:
- Neural Network
