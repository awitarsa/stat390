# Progress Report: 4/22-4/28

## Team Senioritis: Seonuk Kim, Brock Underberg, Ashley Witarsa

### MCMF
#### Progress/Accomplishments:
- Started working on an interactive dashboard in pandas for visualization 
- Created pivot tables for added flexiility in visualizations 
- Split dataset based on meeting type and categories 
- Created visualizations for top categories and meeting type split 
- Identified activities <= 25 max age
#### Problems/Challenges:
- Had a little bit of trouble with pandas version (error: cannot import name 'find_stack_level' from 'pandas.util._exceptions')
#### Plan/Next Steps:
- Continue work on interactive dashboard 
- Identify other important columns for visualization (cost, transportation available, etc.)
- Focus on activities with <= 25 max age: identify patterns, visualizations.
- Complete data visualization tasks and EDA by Wednesday 05/03
- Start and complete presentation for midterm check-in by Thursday 05/04

### Kaggle
#### Progress/Accomplishments:
- Found top 20 predictors with highest correlation with target variable
- Created correlation matrix to see which of the top 20 predictors were correlated with each other; shrunk to 7 predictors
- Handled missing values (dropped rows)
#### Problems/Challenges:
- Have trouble import py-earth in VS Code (can run in Jupyter Notebook)
#### Plan/Next Steps:
- Data visualization for the 7 predictors; consider transformations
- Start developing a model (Random Forest, Boosting, MARS Ensemble) & get initial predictions
- Start and complete presentation for midterm check-in by Thursday 05/04
