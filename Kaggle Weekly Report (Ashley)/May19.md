### Kaggle
#### Progress/Accomplishments: 
- Tuned and ran Lasso, MARS, RandomForests, XGBoost, AdaBoost
- Conducted feature selection based on importances from the models 
- Tried different combinations of different features from feature importances
- Starting to attempt neural networks 
#### Problems/Challenges
- Code takes very very long to run on my laptop, especially when tuning the different models 
#### Plan/Next Steps:
- Ensemble models to continue to improve RMSe 
- Tune neural networks
