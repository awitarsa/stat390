## Ashley Witarsa
### Kaggle
#### Progress/Accomplishments: 
- Identified predictors that had the highest (absolute value) correlation with the target variable 
- Filtered out columns where correlation is NaN
- Dropped NaN values
- Created a pairplot to visualize correlations of these variables with each other, many of them were correlated with each other.
- Started with MARS model
#### Problems/Challenges
- Issues with pandas version errors, had to update installation on conda and terminal
#### Plan/Next Steps:
- Data visualization for the top correlated predictors 
- Identify other important correlations among the predictors and etermine if transformations are needed\
- Run for loop with MARS model to identify best degree
- Decision Tree/RandomForest
- Finish EDA by Wednesday 05/03
- Create presentation and finish by Thursday 05/04
