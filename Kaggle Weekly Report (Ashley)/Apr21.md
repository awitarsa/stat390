### Kaggle
#### Progress/Accomplishments: 
- Data cleaning: explored columns in the dataset, removed empty rows
- Initial visualizations 
- Other EDA 
	⁃	Look at correlations and distributions of variables 
	⁃	Check for outliers/influential points
#### Problems/Challenges
- Currently taking 303-3, so will need to do individual exploration on which models to use (303-3 has only covered up to RandomForests at this point)
#### Plan/Next Steps:
- Identify most important predictors based on correlations by 4/28
- Run first models (ex. MARS) and cross-validate by 4/28
